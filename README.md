Locale is a powerful developer tool designed to provide comprehensive geographical information about Nigeria. With Locale's API, developers can access data on Nigeria's regions, states, and local government areas (LGAs). It caters to businesses and developers seeking to build applications for Nigeria's vast population of over 200 million people.

Requirements and Implementation Guide:
Authentication and Authorization:
Locale API requires authentication for access. Developers must obtain an API key upon signup to authenticate their requests securely. API keys are generated uniquely for each developer and are accessible only once.

Search Functionality:
Locale offers search functionality based on three categories: region, state, and local government area (LGA). Developers can search for specific information, such as regions containing states or states containing LGAs. Searches return comprehensive metadata associated with each region, state, or LGA.

General APIs:
Developers can utilize Locale's APIs to retrieve data on all regions, states, and LGAs.
